Welcome to my Python Data Structures Tutorial. In this tutorial I will cover the following three topics:

1. [Stack](2-stack.md)
2. [Sets](3-sets.md)
3. [Trees](4-trees.md)

In each of the above sections, you will find descriptions of the listed Data Structure, Big-O performance, python implementation, example code, and a problem to solve.
