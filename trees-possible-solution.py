        side (thus getting the smaller numbers first), then we will 
        provide the data in the current node, and finally we will 
        traverse on the right side (thus getting the larger numbers last).

        The use of the 'yield' will allow this function to support loops
        like:

        The keyword 'yield' will return the value for the 'for' loop to
	    use.  When the 'for' loop wants to get the next value, the code in
	    this function will start back up where the last 'yield' returned a 
	    value.  The keyword 'yield from' is used when our generator function
        needs to call another function for which a `yield` will be called.  
        In other words, the `yield` is delegated by the generator function
        to another function.

        the __iter__ function.
